p [1, 2, 3, 4].length # Outputs 4. Total number of items. Length always counts like a human and starts from 1.
p [1, 2, 3, 4].size # Operates the same as length but apparently more optimised in the backend of Ruby.
p [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1].count(4) # Counts how many times the argument appears in the array.
