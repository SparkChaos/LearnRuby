p 1 + 4 # p method will add 1 and 4 together through the addition operator to output 5.

p 10 - 6 # Subtraction operator will give us 4 and p will output this.

p 3 * 4 # Multiplication operator will give us 12 and p will output this.

p "School" + "bus" # Does string concatenation to create "Schoolbus"

p 10 / 5  # Division operator will give us 2 and p will output this.

p 12 / 5 # Division will return 2 and give us the integer result and not the float result, as Ruby does integer division.

p 12.0 / 5 # Converted 12 from integer to float and allowed the division to operate properly. 

p 2 ** 4 # 2^4, results in 16. Double asterisk is for 'to the power of'

p 5 % 2 # Modulo operator shows the remainder. In this instance, it would be 1.
